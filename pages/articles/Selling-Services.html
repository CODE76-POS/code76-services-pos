        <h2><strong>STEP 1: PEFORMING THE SERVICE SEARCH IN THE MAIN PLATFORM.STEP 1: PEFORMING THE PRODUCT SEARCH IN THE MAIN PLATFORM.</strong></h2>
        <p>
            The MAIN PLATFORM is the first platform displayed after you Login in CODE76 SERVICES POS.<br>
            If you are not there, then Move your Cursor to and Select the MAIN PLATFORM tab header.<br>
            Then navigate towards and click on the Search Entry Bar.<br>
            Start typing the desired Service in the Search Entry Bar.<br>
            * NB: Your desired Service must already exist in the Inventory Database, else add it in the inventory. <br>
            Notice that suggestions (Service already in the Inventory) will appear just below the search bar. <br>
            Now you don’t even need to type the Service name, Just select it from the Suggestions.<br>
            Once you select from the suggestion, Notice the entire Service name with automatically fill in your Search Entry Bar.<br>
            If that’s the Product you want, Go ahead and Click on the “ADD ITEM” Blue button .<br>
            As a result, Your Service Name, Service Nickname/Group, Code, Selling Price and UOM (Units Of Measurements) will appear on the right-side of the screen. <br>

        <h2><strong>STEP 2: ADDING YOUR SERVICE INTO THE SHOPPING CART.</strong></h2>
        <p>
            Now that you have searched and displayed your desired service you want to add to the shopping cart, now we add  the remaining information.
            The remaining information is just the Service Quantity, Discount Included and Additional Amount Included.
            Type in the Service Quantity your customer desires to buy.
            Type in the Discount Amount you desire to give the customer for that service.
            Type in the Additional Amount you desire to give the customer for that service.
            The Discount And/or Additional Amount is optional, hence it can be left zero.
            If everything is Good, Go ahead and Click on the green “ADD SERVICE” Button.
            Which will add your product to the shopping cart table on the Left side of the screen.
            The Best Part: most of the important calculations is done for you i.e.. Final Price, Initial Price, Total Discount, Total Additional amount and Total Final Price.
            Now repeat STEP 1 and the Above Steps, to add more services to the shopping cart table on the Left side of the screen. <br>
        </p>

        <h2><strong>STEP 3: GIVING OUT THE COMMISSION.</strong></h2>
        <p>
            Now that you have searched and displayed your desired service and added all your desired services in the shopping cart, now we give commission.
            Before the Commission you select the customer.
            Then Select the Commission Recipient.
            Next Type in the Commission Percentage to give out from the Sales Amount.
            The Commission Amount that the Commission Recipient Will receive, will be automatically be calculated by CODE76 SERVICES POS.
            The Commission Amount will be displayed at the Sales History Section after you sell after the Sales Operation is completed.
            Notice, that the Sales Recipients options are customers and company members, hence the customers and company members must be available.

        <h2><strong>STEP 4: LISTING THOSE INVOLVED WITH THE SERVICES.</strong></h2>
        <p>
            After Selecting the customers and setting the Commission.<br>
            Then start to add those company members involved doing the services.<br>
            First select the Company Member. <br>
            Second click on the green “ADD MEMBER INVOLVED” Button.<br>
            The Member involved will be added in the List. <br>
            To remove the member involved, just click on the green “REMOVE MEMBER INVOLVED” Button. <br>
            This step is very important and cannot be left out empty. <br>
            If there are no members to select, it means that the members information is not added in the company’s members database. <br>
            If the members are there, then just Restart the application.<br>
        </p>

        <h2><strong>STEP 5: COLLECTING PAYMENTS FROM YOUR CUSTOMERS.</strong></h2>
        <p> 
            After step 1, 2,3 & 4, Now we proceed to collect the payments from your customer. <br>
            Now click on the “SELL SERVICES” Green Button on the bottom left side. <br>
            Which will redirect you to the Payment Section. <br>
            Once the Payment Section appears on the Right Side, <br>
            Select on the methods of Payments the customer desires to pay with and their respective amounts. <br>
            Remember to Notify the Customer, that he/she is supposed to pay the amount indicated by the blue label “Expected Amount”, <br>
            which is the Total Final Price for the Shopping Cart Table. <br> 
            Once done, Now click on the “TAKE GIVEN AMOUNT” Green Button. <br>

        <h2><strong>STEP 6: ACCEPT THE PAYMENT AND CONCLUDE THE SALES.</strong></h2>
        <p>
            Now after doing STEP 5, notice CODE76 SERVICES POS has already done the Total Calculation the Customer has Paid. <br>
            And also calculated the customer change or debt, based on the Expected amount and the Total Amount given by the Customer. <br>
            If there is a Debt, notify the customer about the incomplete payments. <br>
            The Customer can pay the remaining amount or negotiate about paying for the Products Later. <br>
            NB: The Good news is that Now CODE76 SERVICES POS gives you the Power to allow customers buy now and pay later,<br>
            Because it keeps debts records and gives on-start Debt notifications about any existing debt.<br>
            If there is any Customer Change, give the customer his/her the change amount.<br>
            Now conclude the selling by clicking on the green “ACCEPT PAYMENT” button.<br>
        </p>

        <br><br>
        <h2><strong>STEP 7: JUST REPEAT THE PROCESS TO SELL MORE PRODUCTS.</strong></h2>
        <p> 
            Just repeat step 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 & 6 to continue doing more selling.
            All Selling Operations are recorded in the Sales History Database, and to confirm this you just need to go to the REPORT PLATFORM, then to the SALES HISTORY to check your sales history record. <br>
            if you made a mistake on adding the wrong Product/Item on the Shopping Cart, just select the shopping cart table row for the product, then on the right side click on the blue “DELETE ITEM” Button. <br>
            If you have made many Errors/Mistakes during your Selling Operation, Don’t Panic – Just click the blue “VOID ORDER” Button to delete everything and start the entire process again. <br>
            But If maybe you realize you have done many Errors/Mistakes on your Sales Operation and Already you clicked on the “ACCEPT PAYMENTS” Button, Don’t Panic – Just go to the REPORT PLATFORM, then to the SALES HISTORY, find and delete the Sales History record. <br>
